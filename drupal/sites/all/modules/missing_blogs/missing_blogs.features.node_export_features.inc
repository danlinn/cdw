<p>TBI’s Annual Awards celebrate those who are working hard to educate the public, to provide excellence in journalism, and for a lifetime of dedication to the values of environmental sustainability.&nbsp; This year’s awardees include <a href=""https://www.watereducation.org/doc.asp?id=862"" target=""_blank"">Rita Sudman</a>, Executive Director of the Water Education Foundation, which – in addition to producing the maps in virtually every office of anyone who works on California water – has been a pioneer in encouraging, supporting and training the next generation of water leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ariel Rubissow Okamoto and Kathleen Wong, long time Bay Area journalists, are getting well-deserved recognition for their excellent primer,<em> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Natural-History-Francisco-California-Guides/dp/0520268261"" target=""_blank"">The Natural History of San Francisco</a></em>, which gathers stories, facts and insights from more than 60 scientists, activists, and resource managers, demonstrating how the conflicts around the SF Bay sparked an environmental awakening that now reaches across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TBI’s award for lifetime achievement is going to law professor extraordinaire, <a href=""http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Dunning/"" target=""_blank"">Hap Dunning</a> of UC Davis, one of the most brilliant and influential water law scholars on the national scene, an indefatigable writer and thinker, who has devoted countless hours to solving some of California’s thorniest problems with reason, creativity and grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course Carpe Diem West’s own <a href=""http://www.carpediemwest.org/who-we-are/staff"" target=""_blank"">Cynthia Koehler</a> is being given TBI’s Bay Hero Award for her work on behalf of sustainable water policy in California. &nbsp;Policy wonk, writer, negotiator, litigator, and elected official, Cynthia has been at the center of many important success stories - from the State Board proceeding that saved Mono Lake, to enactment of water bonds that funded restoration projects, to adoption of public trust flow recommendations for the Bay Delta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together these folks, and TBI’s past awardees, demonstrate every day the power of commitment, intelligence and collaboration to address our environmental challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other communities around the West are implementing natural “green infrastructure” solutions. Our recent report, <a href=""http://carpediemwest.org/newvisions-smartchoices"" target=""_blank"">New Visions – Smart Choices</a> highlights just a few of these innovative projects. Clean Water Services in Oregon has planted shade trees to <a href=""http://www.cleanwaterservices.org/Content/Watershed/Integrated%20Watershed%20Management%20Case%20Study%20.pdf"" target=""_blank"">cool local waterways</a> (PDF), keeping the river downstream a safe temperature for native fish. Restoring riparian trees in the local watershed allowed Clean Water Services to avoid building a $150 million cooling system to meet temperature regulations for treated wastewater. Similarly, Salt Lake City is <a href=""http://www.slcgov.com/node/212"" target=""_blank"">protecting its pristine headwaters</a> in the Wasatch Range to keep the City’s drinking water clean and flowing. The City uses a mix of conservation, land use regulation and public education, among other programs, to protect the health of local municipal watersheds.</p>
<p>As the American West begins to more acutely feel the impacts of climate change, natural resource managers will need to build resiliency into their systems to lessen the economic and environmental hardship associated with a warming climate. From wetland water treatment to green infrastructure and reinstating natural fire regimes, communities facing challenges to their water systems should ask themselves, “what would nature do?”&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">And drought, as we all know, doesn’t just mean drought. It also means <a href=""http://www.thepampanews.com/news/article_f178f0e6-d2cf-11e2-b3c8-001a4bcf6878.html"">declining aquifers</a>, <a href=""http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/15/18975566-colorado-fire-now-most-destructive-in-state-history?lite"">wildfires</a>, and <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/37341-west-becoming-dustier.html"">dust</a> – lots of it.<br></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Perhaps most disturbingly, dust that lands on snow, as is increasingly the case in the inner mountain west, <a href=""http://www.postindependent.com/news/6814071-113/dust-colorado-landry-snow"">changes the way the snowpack melts</a>. Clean, white snow has a high albedo, or reflectivity; sunlight bounces off snow without a great increase in temperature. Enter dust: dust-covered snow is darker, and therefore absorbs more of the sun’s energy as heat, causing it to melt at a faster rate – just think about the last time you wore a dark colored shirt on a sunny day and how hot it felt. This increased melting rate changes runoff patterns, challenging water managers to plan releases from storage facilities at times when water is needed downstream (for farming, fish, recreationists, etc.), while ensuring adequate space to accommodate an earlier peak runoff.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">But there are bright spots.&nbsp; Many innovative water managers around the West have seen dry times coming and have taken steps to protect water supplies. A number of communities highlighted in our report <a href=""http://carpediemwest.org/newvisions-smartchoices""><em>New Visions, Smart Choices</em></a> are doing just that.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">When, for example, the Yampa River nearly ran dry in 2012, the Colorado Water Trust exercised a new Colorado State law to lease spare water in the Stagecoach Reservoir from the Upper Yampa Water Conservancy District. The leased water restored flows in the river, saving fish and the local recreation economy from impending doom.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">While not all of us have neighbors who can lease us water in dry times, every community can make a difference by conserving our scarce water resources. Whether that means finding creative ways to reuse water, or rethinking landscape design on a grander scale, there are straightforward steps we can take right now to safeguard our water supplies from present (and future!) drought conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
