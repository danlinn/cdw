<p><span style="font-size: small;">Great news—the second phase of the <a href="http://www.carpediemwestacademy.org" target="_blank">Carpe Diem West Academy</a>&nbsp;is off and running thanks to the generous support of the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation. Since launching the website this spring, the Academy has been providing western water managers with a logical framework and vetted tools to help make smarter choices in this era of uncertainty. The second phase adds more user-friendly bells and whistles to the website, and, starting this month, we’re launching an interactive learning community and webinar series. The Academy is a one-stop site to access climate assessment tools and resources for any stage in the decision-making process, and at any management level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For this month’s <em>Confluence</em> we talked with Dr. Kristen Averyt, at <a href="http://wwa.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">Western Water Assessment</a>, about decision-making challenges facing western water managers, and with David Behar of the San Francisco PUC and the <a href="http://www.wucaonline.org/html/" target="_blank">Water Utilities Climate Alliance</a>&nbsp;on his perspective from a municipal utility seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Deputy Director</span><br><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://wwa.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">Western Water Assessment</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q: What are some of the biggest challenges facing western water managers seeking to incorporate climate change into their work?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>KA:&nbsp;</strong>What I see is that climate change isn’t the only problem – water managers are also dealing with a host of other factors. Population growth. Changing demand regimes. It’s not so much that climate change constitutes a separate problem, but that it enhances all of these problems. For example, in the Colorado Basin we’re expecting to see flows decline between 5 and 20 percent due to climate change. But if, say, demand increases by 50 percent in the same time frame, which issue might be more urgent to address? Climate change makes it all the more urgent that we get better at efficiently using and managing water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q: Water managers have traditionally focused on certainty. Have you seen that culture shift in response to the new era of uncertainty brought on by climate change?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>KA:&nbsp;</strong>I think it’s a misnomer to call climate change a new era of uncertainty. The truth is that water managers have <em>always</em> dealt with uncertainty. They’ve always asked themselves, “what are the worst conditions we’re likely to see” – the worst drought, the worst flood, and so forth – and then plan for that. Climate change just changes the realm of possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I also don’t think uncertainty is as paralyzing as it’s made out to be. In arid regions like the Southwest, water managers have always developed innovative approaches to deal with arid conditions, and now we’re seeing the same folks get together to talk about water management in ways we’ve never seen before. One example is the <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/environment/climate-change/Pages/JointFrontRangeClimateChangeVulnerabilityStudy.aspx" target="_blank">Joint Front Range Climate Change Vulnerability Study</a>, where the Colorado Front Range water providers pooled their resources to work with local scientists to develop a collective approach to dealing with climate change. By the end of that study, the water managers were discussing the finer technical points of climate models and downscaling methods right alongside the scientists. That was a big step forward. And the real value of those collaborations is not so much the end product, but the process itself. It paves the way for future collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q: What’s a topic you’d like to see the Carpe Diem West Academy take on in the coming months?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>KA:&nbsp;</strong>What we’ve found in our research and through conversations with water resource managers is that it’s not just about generating new information or providing better training on how to use climate information. Rather, we find that people aren’t aware of many of the climate tools that are already out there to help provide decision-making support. This suggests that scientists and developers may not be successfully marketing or advertising the tools they produce, and this creates a real disconnect with the user community. What we really need is to invest in getting the word out, perhaps more so than in new tools. And it’s great to see the work the Carpe Diem West Academy is doing to fill that need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>[img_assist|nid=143|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=95|height=100]&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Climate Program Director</span><br><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.sfwater.org/" target="_blank">San Francisco Public Utilities Commission</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q: What are some of the biggest challenges western water managers face in incorporating climate change into their work?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>DB:&nbsp;</strong><span>Water managers face three major challenges. The first challenge is finding partners to help us understand the nature of climate change and what the science says it will do in our local geography.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The second challenge is dealing with the uncertainties embedded in these answers, because we’re not going to get clear predictions – instead, we’re going to get wide ranges of possible effects. In some cases, particularly in the West, these ranges will fall on either side of zero – for example, in many areas, we aren’t certain whether precipitation will increase or decrease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The third challenge is evaluating the timing and cost of adaptation measures – for example, different options for protecting infrastructure from various degrees of sea level rise. In most cases, these decisions lie in our future, not our present. But at some point they will come to dominate our thinking about climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-size: small;">How have you seen the culture and practices of western water managers adapt in response to climate uncertainties?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>DB:&nbsp;</strong>As the famous article said, “stationarity is dead.” In the past, utilities planned for the future based on the past – typically 50 to 100 years of historical data on things like streamflow. But to quote the late [Denver Water General Manager] Chips Berry, “the future ain’t what it used to be.” Now utilities need tools that will tell us what will happen if temperatures warm by, say, three degrees Celsius. Our operational models can’t tell us that. We need to develop hydrological models that will physically model our entire watershed and allow us to input different numbers for temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, and predict what will happen under a range of scenarios. Those models can be expensive to develop and calibrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-size: small;">As a water manager, in what way can you see yourself using the Carpe Diem West Academy?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>DB:&nbsp;</strong>If the Academy can contribute to the application of quality assurance/quality control principles to the use of climate information, that would be a major contribution to our ability to assess our vulnerability to climate change. Every water manager has to face the question of what climate information to use in their models – and it’s a non-trivial question. There is a very wide range of models out there, and there’s a real danger associated with using just one – even one that “predicts” the past pretty well – and thinking you understand the future. We need expertise from the climate science community to be able to apply the largest range of models possible, sift through data available today, and evaluate new information as it is developed in a rapidly changing field.</span></p>

    \'title\' => \'Colorado River Solutions\',
    \'body\' => \'<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Colorado River Basin faces profound long-term water management challenges. Annual water demand now roughly equals annual supply, and climate change is expected to make the basin much drier. While decision-makers at many levels are aware of this challenge, opportunities for a wider variety of stakeholders to contribute solutions has, up to now, been limited. Conservationists, Tribes, rural farm communities, and many others all have a strong interest in the outcome of Colorado Basin water management decisions, but no direct representation in the negotiations on the future of the river. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> In response to the Bureau of Reclamation’s call for options to the Basin Study, Carpe Diem West proposes the creation of an informal, self-governing, ongoing forum for discussing long-term water solutions for the Colorado Basin. Together, a wide variety of stakeholders would launch this “parallel process,” which would serve as a forum for sharing views, developing proposals, and providing input to the basin states and the Bureau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> We believe that solutions vetted through such a diverse stakeholder group will be more durable, less controversial, and more likely to succeed in today’s tight funding environment. Our research to date indicates that many basin leaders see the same opportunity, and that such stakeholder engagement mechanisms have been successful in other river basins around the country.</span></p>

    \'title\' => \'Interviews with Charlie Ester and Rosalind Bark\',
    \'body\' => \'<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Managing the Phoenix water supply:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;">An interview with Charlie Ester</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Charlie Ester has been playing with water since he was a kid spending summers at a cabin in Arizona. But today, it’s on a much grander scale. As the manager of water resource operations for the Salt River Project (SRP) for the past 15 years, he is responsible for delivering nearly a million acre-feet of water per year to customers in metropolitan Phoenix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Q: You are responsible for delivering water to an increasing population in a time of a sustained drought. How is the SRP managing expectations among the public for what they can expect their water service to be like in the coming years? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>CE: </strong>We are keeping the public informed as to the extent of the drought, and also actively managing the water we do have and seeking ways to increase our resilience and the reliability of our supply. At this point, we plan to continue to meet customer expectations in the Phoenix area as we have in the past—we’ve not come out and said that we’re going to require reductions in water use. However, we are advising people to voluntarily conserve water and use it wisely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Are you working with neighboring regional water suppliers to manage water availability?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>Our largest neighbor is the Central Arizona Project, which brings in Colorado River water from the western border of Arizona. Their water supply comes all the way from the headwaters of the Colorado in Colorado and Wyoming, and of course we do work closely with them. We’ve done some joint communications because we’ve found it’s really important that we all be consistent when we’re talking about this. You can really lose credibility fast if one agency says, “Oh my God, the sky is falling, we need to conserve water,” and the other one says, “Hey everything’s fine, no problem.” But we’re not developing water supplies jointly or anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>To what do you attribute the current 17-year drought the SRP is experiencing? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>I believe it is the result of a combination of factors that have existed for thousands of years. If you look back at the tree-ring record, you see that there have been many droughts in the past that lasted as long if not longer, and were as severe if not more severe. But coupled with that, things like for example the intense summer heat we’re seeing might be attributed to other changes throughout the world—whether you want to call it global warming, climate change or whatever. But not all of it—certainly not all of it. I don’t want to attribute this drought entirely to human impacts on the climate. It’s a combination of factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>How does your relationship with Carpe Diem West relate to your work on the SRP?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>Their interests are very much in line with our interests in terms of protecting our headwater areas. We are fully behind Carpe Diem West’s efforts to manage our headwater forests so that they’re healthier and can withstand the effects of droughts, insects, fire, and climate change—whether it’s natural or human-induced. The catastrophic fires that so many forests in the West are prone to now have caused us to rethink the way we have historically managed forests. We’ve learned over the decades that we shouldn’t have been putting out all those fires—we should have been managing them to promote forest health, and thinning some of the trees that grew up because of fire suppression.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So the Carpe Diem West message is our message. By combining all these agencies, interests and different communities together as one voice, I believe we can get much more done than if we were all out there trying to do this on our own.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Can you describe SRP’s customers? Is it a mix of agricultural entities and urban residents and businesses?&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>There are a few agricultural interests, but the vast majority of our water now goes to urban interests, both residential and businesses. That’s not how it always was, of course—but as the Phoenix area has grown, we’ve done a complete turnaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Phoenix is such a harsh climate that close to 60 percent of our water use is still used for landscaping. But over the last 10 to 15 years we’ve seen a huge drop in per-capita water use, even as the population has increased dramatically. The two biggest factors, I believe, have been education and a slow transition from outside landscaping water use. Everyone used to put in grass, and now they are more inclined to do desert and xeroscaping—still very nice landscaping, but much less water intensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Of course there have also been new codes for low-flow toilets, shower heads and so forth. But I think it’s been outside watering habits that have caused the greatest change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Do you see the price of water going up in the next decade? How do you make sure that all income levels continue to have access to clean drinking water?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>I believe the price of water will go up, but even in 10 years, I don’t believe its true value will be reflected. Right now water is very much underpriced, and it tends to be subsidized throughout the West.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Most cities today have an increasing block rate structure. The first few units or thousands of gallons of water are virtually free. As a society, we agree that there’s an inherent human right to a certain amount of water, so that comes at a very reasonable price. Then, if you are affluent enough to water your yard or have your entire landscaping be ponds or what-have-you—if you are willing to pay for it—then you can do that. I think we’ll continue to see that those who want just a subsistence amount of water can get it at an extremely reasonable rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>You\\\'ve been playing around with water since you were a kid, by all accounts. Why the fascination, and what motivates you now in your work?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong>CE:&nbsp;</strong></span>You know, I’ve always loved water and weather—seeing rain turn into runoff and knowing that it flows downhill and gets to our lakes and then we use it everyday in our lives. Water is such a ubiquitous part of our world and yet so many people take it for granted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I was once in a meeting with a bunch of Future Farmers of America members who had come to SRP for a tour. I was there to talk about the water supply, and how we manage the watershed, rivers and reservoirs and so forth. But our president at the time, John Lasson, had some opening comments for the group. And here he is, the president of a very large water and power utility. You have to know that our power side dwarfs the size of our water company. We have a million power customers, which amounts to a couple billion dollars and about 4,600 employees—compared to the water side, which has 350 employees. His message for those future farmers was that, as big as the power side of this company is, it’s the water side that’s important. I mean, you can live without electricity, but try living without water.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So I think my motivation is really just how important it is, especially living in this desert environment. Nature is pretty stingy with us—she doesn’t give us a lot of water, but then, boy once in awhile we get a ton of it. I’ll have been here 30 years in June. Every day is a new adventure, and I’ve been really blessed to have had such a wonderful career opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a name="rbark"></a></strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Dialogue of the river basins:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;">An interview with Dr. Rosalind Bark</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Dr. Rosalind Bark is Resource Ecological Economist at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency. While her focus currently is on water management and planning for the Murray-Darling Basin in southeastern Australia, she spent eight years at the University of Arizona, where she worked on system management reforms and climate change adaptation strategies for the Colorado River Basin. Rosalind participated in our June 21, 2012 webinar, and we followed up with this interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>As someone who grew up in Hong Kong, studied at Oxford, and has worked on large-scale river basin management on two continents, you bring a unique perspective to water managers in the American West. What are the most important things you learned from your experience at the University of Arizona? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB: </strong>The University of Arizona is recognized for being quite interdisciplinary, and growing up in that environment academically, doing my PhD and post doctorate there was very important. Paleohydrologists and hydrologists were talking the same language, which helped me gain an understanding of how important modeling is as a predictive tool.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Arizona is a leader in paleohydrology—looking at tree ring records as they existed during prehistoric eras to understand past stream flow. Combining that science with other stream flow scenarios is an advantage, and that’s something they don’t have here in Australia to the same extent, because they don’t have the tree-ring records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Another thing that happens in America is that stakeholders are very engaged at each level. You have the seven basin states talking a lot as a group, and conversations happening between the U.S. and Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission and NGOs. Being a part of all of that was really useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It’s also instructive how much, in the U.S., indigenous water rights are integrated into planning and engagement. Here, at least in the Murray-Darling Basin, we don’t have the same indigenous water rights settlement process. And basin indigenous communities have very little land ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>What are the differences between the two countries in how they are managing water and the environment?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB:&nbsp;</strong>Both countries have big, urban water and irrigation demands and competing environmental demands. In Australia, the drive for water reform in the basin in 2007 was the environment. And although there’s quite a lot of interest in America—in Cienega de Santa Clara and the Delta ecosystem, for instance—the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a basin-wide look at fresh water ecosystems. Reforms that took place that same year in the Colorado River basin (with the <em>Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead</em>) were driven more by shortage sharing and urban water supply reliability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here on the Murray-Darling, the proposed Basin Plan would reduce extractive flow by a quarter to meet environmental needs. This plan is based on a bottom-up science process, where scientists looked at how much the ecosystems in the basin required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I think that process of integrating the environment in basin planning is happening in America—it’s certainly happening in the Delta with Karl Flessa’s work at the University of Arizona. But here in Australia it seems to be much farther advanced. Having said that, the political realities of passing a plan that sets aside a large portion of water flow for the environment is very contentious, both here and on the Colorado River.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>Can you talk about how well the Australian public accepts the reality of climate change and its affect on water, and how those attitudes are different in the United States? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB:&nbsp;</strong>CSIRO scientist, Dr. Rod McCrae, has recently been doing research about how attitudes surrounding climate change are expressed in Australian politics, which I find very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In Perth, Australia, on the west coast, they have had a marked reduction in water supply, and a lot of their water now comes from desalination. So there, they may have a greater sense of the link between changed climate and changed water availability. Here in Murray-Darling Basin, there is talk about climate change, and CSIRO has looked at possible impacts on stream flow in the basin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>What communication strategies have worked in either country that might be useful in advancing understanding and increasing urgency around the topic?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB:&nbsp;</strong>I do think America has many more avenues for communication. Carpe Diem West Academy definitely plays a role. They seem very open to feedback, and I think they have a good dialogue with the people who participate in their seminars. That’s a hard thing to do—staying really engaged with stakeholders and not having it be just a one-way conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The University of Arizona College of Science hosted a series of seminars while I was there, and they filled up Centennial Hall week after week. It was professors young and old talking about their science in a very accessible way. I don’t think I have seen that here in Australia, though I have been here less than two years. The University of Arizona and Carpe Diem West do a good job reaching different sections of society, whether it is the general public or water managers specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>How are water managers in Australia managing the price of water, and making sure that all income levels are served? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB:&nbsp;</strong>In the Murray-Darling Basin there is an active water market, with agricultural irrigators trading water. Urban and town water is part of critical human water needs and top priority. As a renter I don’t pay water rates but, like in Arizona, they do have tiered consumption charges and a fixed water access charge. In Adelaide, where I lived until recently, water prices have been rising and in 2011-12 they went up nearly 30 percent. Some of the increase was attributed to large water projects, including a desalination plant. Every large city in Australia now has a desalination plant, although the only city that uses theirs regularly is Perth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><strong><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></strong>How and why did you begin working in this field, and what motivates you?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>RB:&nbsp;</strong>I grew up in Hong Kong, a place where water is relatively scarce, even though it rains a lot in the summer time, so I certainly had an interest in water scarcity. Then when I moved to the Southwest, it was clear that was where my research interest would lie. And you know, the Colorado River Basin has been of interest to many researchers in many different fields for a long time. I think the interesting thing now is how often it’s really a consortium of interdisciplinary researchers working on the same issues. I liked the combination of academics, practitioners, interested people, and NGOs—it really was an exciting place to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I think it’s interesting how much exchange there is between the American Southwest and the Murray-Darling Basin. In the time I’ve been here there have been at least half a dozen American practitioners and researchers who have come on sabbaticals or to speak or be part of a conference. And it happens the other way too, with scientists and practitioners going to America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I hope this dialogue between Southeastern Australia and the Southwestern U.S. continues. I think there is quite a lot to learn, not only in system management and modeling, but also things like indigenous water rights and environmental restoration. I would love to see our work benefit other countries that also have a lot of variability and competing demands in their river basins.&nbsp;</span></p>\',

<p>This media coverage analysis from a Duke University researcher confirms much of what we already know about gaining media attention on climate - tell an underdog story, focus on major events and policy &amp; new research. However, it\\\'s interesting to note that technology-driven stories outperform market-based solution stories on climate, and that automotive advancement stories in relation to climate solutions are also popular with the press.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="list_sub_title"><strong>The Merger Project</strong><br></span>Here at Exloco we\\\'ve been tracking mergers in the western environmental community for the past few years.

<p><span>While many nonprofits in other sectors are have merged, mergers between environmental advocacy organizations have been few and far between. The purpose of the Merger Project is to reframe mergers as a way for environmental work, and the people who do that work, to thrive. </span></p>

In the process, S-BAR creates a level playing field, a unified calculus that answers the questions: How good is "good enough"? How good are we now? and What will it take for us to be viewed credibly as a "sustainable business"?</p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: small;">John Fleck is a journalist at the Albuquerque Journal, where he writes about water in the American West. He’s currently working on a book examining the west\\\'s water problems, focused on the solution space.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>Do you have a favorite story from the report?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As we grapple with drought this year in the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins in real time, the story of last year’s water deal on the Yampa is heartening. I watch water managers staring at their spreadsheets imagining different ways we could allocate the scarce water available. The mathematical models show that we’ve got to maximize multiple community benefits. But we all too frequently lack the institutional tools to click the right boxes. The Yampa offers an example of engaged communities creating a framework that provides the flexibility to collaboratively move water around to meet multiple needs - without top-down enforcement regimes or litigation. It’s a hopeful model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>Why is it so important to tell these stories?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For communities concerned about their resource future - because of drought-driven water shortages, long term water demands outstripping supply and changes as a result of humans’ inadvertent tinkering with climate - the situation can seem overwhelming. Examples like those in the report, of steps other communities have taken in response to this universal set of problems, are vital. The measure of success here will come when someone in a community struggling with a problem calls the folks on the Yampa, or in San Diego or Santa Fe, to start a conversation about how it was done, and how they can duplicate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>How do stories help us connect climate change to people and their daily lives?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We humans are storytellers (and story-listeners). It’s in our DNA, and for good reason. For most of our species’ history, it’s how we got the big things done. The abstractions of policy analysis, the contributions of water engineers and climate scientists trying to help us find a way out of these problems - the new inventions of written language - are all critical. But the scope of the problem and the weighty depth of the technocrats’ proposals for addressing our dilemmas can create a sense combined bewilderment and hopelessness in individuals. It’s easy to look at the choked forests in the mountains above your town and wonder what might be done. It’s helpful to hear the story from someone who saw that and did something about it. We need the stories - to help us grasp the problems but more importantly to visualize the fact that there are solutions out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></span><em><span style="font-size: small;">Scott is CEO of Resource Media, a nonprofit public relations firm helping partners succeed in today’s dynamic media landscape, and a member of Carpe Diem West’s Board of Directors.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>Do you have a favorite story from the report?</em></strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">My favorite story in the report is the way Salt Lake City has embraced green infrastructure and watershed protection. It shows that these issues, when framed properly, are not partisan. In fact, green infrastructure may be a way not only to supersede partisan politics but also to get citizens to interact with their government in a more positive way. Infrastructure, like functioning water systems, is something people expect government to do, whatever their perspectives might be on whether government is "too big" or "too small". And guess what? Citizens will even pay to protect and improve that infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>Why is it so important to tell these stories?</em></strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Climate change is the issue of our time. And the trouble with issues of our time is that they can be overwhelming, depressing….disempowering…for the public. When you are pounded by the science of climate change, it is hard to see how one individual or even one watershed can make any difference. We need to get past that or else nothing will happen. It is not really about the carbon kept out of the atmosphere. It is about local collaborations setting the tone, showing the way for bigger efforts at the scale the problem will ultimately require. And it is about giving people the sense of hope they need to bring their best thinking forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>How do stories help us connect climate change to people and their daily lives?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Again, the science of climate change is oppressive and unyielding. &nbsp;People don\\\'t process facts to form opinions. They process stories that trigger existing values. As we have told clients for years, people decide with their hearts, not their heads. By communicating success stories about actions that make us more resilient to climate change, you are connecting with people where it counts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>[img_assist|nid=285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=68|height=100]Karen Knudsen is Executive Director of the Clark Fork Coalition, a Missoula, Montana-based nonprofit working to build a healthier Clark Fork watershed through science-driven advocacy, community outreach, and on-the-ground partnerships in environmental restoration.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Outside of the Upper Clark Fork being the largest Superfund clean up site in the United States, what makes the Clark Fork restoration special?</strong>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Clark Fork restoration is special because it’s living proof of nature’s resiliency and a dramatic example of what can be accomplished in the West’s historically hard-working river valleys through a cooperative conservation agenda focused on water.&nbsp; Not long ago, the Clark Fork routinely ran red with pollution.&nbsp; It had been over-mined, over-logged, over-grazed, and plain over-worked.&nbsp; And it had seen its share of water wars, too.&nbsp; But it’s a place where the seeds of teamwork now have taken hold and diverse stakeholders are coming together to make the Clark Fork clean, healthy, and whole.&nbsp; And the bonus here: yesterday’s mistakes and oversights are today’s paydirt in terms of the ecological interest, restoration jobs and economic boost a restored landscape will start earning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Tell us about some of the economic and non-economic values of a healthy Clark Fork watershed.</strong>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here in western Montana, the economic and non-economic values of a healthy watershed are one and the same.&nbsp; Sure, we can talk about the tourism dollars our recreational trout fishery generates, or the cattle yields and hay crops that year-round streamflows produce, or the flood protection and pollution filtering that riparian plants provide. But at the end of the day, it’s all connected, and it’s all about water and the values that are fundamental to our health, productivity, and quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Tell us about what restoration means and will mean to the key stakeholders in the Upper Clark Fork Basin.&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We don’t have a crystal ball (though we’re always on the look-out for one!).&nbsp; And it’s impossible to know the exact trajectory of climate-related changes and development pressures on the horizon, and how those will affect ranchers, recreationists, water rate-payers, and local economies. &nbsp;But we maintain that watershed restoration is the best insurance policy any stakeholder has.&nbsp; Because when we engage in restoration—which in the Clark Fork watershed means removing pollution, rewatering thirsty streams, rehabilitating riparian habitats, and reconnecting tributaries—we are creating a healthy physical environment that is resilient to external shocks and rich in the natural capital that underpins livable communities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What lessons have you learned that others trying to “value” their watersheds might appreciate?</strong>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Quantifying the values of your watershed is an important exercise when it comes to building support for restoration.&nbsp; You need the hard numbers. But ultimately, that’s not what moves the needle.&nbsp; It’s a vision of what’s to be gained through restoration, or what’s to be lost through inaction.&nbsp; What we try to ask is “what do those ‘values’ mean for people’s lives at the ground level?” It’s a grittier, more personal, sometimes politically-charged conversation.&nbsp; But making every effort to engage authentically, personally, and with diverse interests is the key to innovative partnerships—and that’s where unexpected solutions can unfold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Tell us about your work with ranchers in particular – since we loved the <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/sites/carpediemwest.org/files/RestorationCollaboration_MT.pdf">Gold Creek story</a> because the river got healthier, and so did the cows!&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Clark Fork River and its tributaries wind their way through hundreds of miles of private working ranchlands.&nbsp; So the basin’s ranchers and irrigators are central to the restoration effort.&nbsp; In fact, they hold the key to its long-term success.&nbsp; They bring the deep knowledge from generations of being on the land and they are the ones who will live in, learn from, use and interact with the restored landscape now and into the future.&nbsp; Although my group actually owns a cattle ranch—which we bought 8 years ago to spearhead environmental remediation and experiment with conservation practices—we know we’re on a ranching learning curve.&nbsp; And we’ve discovered that certain assumptions don’t pan out—e.g., if a conservation practice increases profits, other ranchers will adopt it, too.&nbsp; Not necessarily true!&nbsp; We have much to learn and appreciate the patience of our neighbors and their tough questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you ever talk about “valuing” the watershed? &nbsp;Does it make sense to talk about ecosystem services with any of your audiences?&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>“Ecosystem services,” “valuing the watershed,” and even “climate change,” are terms we use situationally.&nbsp; Many of our partners and audiences find them chilly, or sterile, or even inflammatory.&nbsp; And as an environmental group working with diverse constituencies and hailing from Montana’s most liberal city, we’ve faced the facts:&nbsp; the words we use get scrutinized and can reinforce negative stereotypes.&nbsp; So we favor warm words and connecting language that puts the focus on the waters we all share.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><a name="BGaffi"></a>Managing from the River\\\'s Perspective:</span></strong></span><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">An Interview with Bill Gaffi&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: small;">[img_assist|nid=287|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=80|height=100]Bill Gaffi is General Manager of Clean Water Services, a water resources management utility committed to protecting water resources in Oregon’s Tualatin River Watershed.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: small;"><br>What made you ask the very unusual question, what does the Tualatin River need?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In the late 1950s, the river was tremendously over-appropriated; 40 miles downstream from the headwaters you could straddle the river. By the late 1960s, a patchwork of 26 inadequate wastewater treatment plants were discharging to local streams and the river.&nbsp; The state stepped in and placed a building moratorium over the entire basin, and thus Clean Water Services was formed, and river restoration began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Our basin has been operating under one of the oldest Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) in the nation, and that has given us a unique perspective. After more 40 years of working to restore the health of the river, we realized that our watershed was like an emergency room patient with a lot of specialists and no overall plan of care.&nbsp; And we were wondering why the patient wasn’t getting better! It became clear that we needed to look at the watershed through the river’s eyes, and with ratepayers in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We realized that we don’t have control over all the factors impacting the river; we needed to partner with those who did. That’s how we decided to build partnerships with all sorts of interests (conservationists, the state, drinking water agencies, and farmers – to name just a few).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What benefits have you seen from your restoration work for the river, for your core business and for your other constituents - particularly up-river farmers?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">First and foremost, Clean Water Services has secured nearly a quarter of the basin’s stored water. We use that water in the summer months to restore flows to the mainstem and tributaries, which in turn improves water quality and critical habitat.&nbsp; We have also focused tremendous energy into restoring nearly 60 miles of riparian corridor. &nbsp;Working in Washington, D.C. we were able to leverage the USDA Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) with utility funds so that farmers could get income off their flood prone properties and avoid risk. These riparian shade investments together with the release of cool water from the reservoirs helped us meet our temperature TMDL through a water quality trading program. The investment is paying dividends for the river and our ratepayers. &nbsp;Had we put in chillers at a 20-year cost of $150 million instead of restoring the river, it would have benefitted only a short stretch of the river. Our investments in restoration cost us less than a tenth of what the chillers would have, and benefitted a much longer stretch of the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Tell us about some of the economic and non-economic values of a healthy Tualatin watershed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Well, that’s a little challenging to quantify! But we have moved from a building moratorium to being called the economic engine of Oregon—home to Intel’s largest facility in the world; corporate headquarters for Nike; and an increasingly strong economic growth and expansion. Still, it’s a work in progress to bring people to the river and to get the community to turn toward the river instead of away from it. To address that, we’re working with land planning organizations to highlight this beautiful asset. We’re working in elementary schools with a program called the Tualatin River Rangers, where we provide the curriculum and the kids learn deeply about the river and the basin. In our other programs, we review development before it affects the stream corridors, and we have a whole Watershed Department that is doing some very innovative work. We also help manage surface waters and stream restoration, for example, helping organize the response to recent ESA listings in the basin and helping with earthquake planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What lessons have you learned that others trying to "value" their watersheds might appreciate?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The most important lesson is this: if we fail to look at the watershed through a more complex lens<span>—</span>a lens that understands all the varied dimensions of the river, not just the water quality issue or the flow issues<span>—</span>we’re going to exhaust people’s willingness to finance us. We have to communicate the whole picture to our ratepayers and to build strong partnerships. We have to build credibility. Otherwise, the prospects for innovating are very limited. The chillers are the perfect example. If we had installed those, instead of naturally cooling the river, Mother Nature would have given us a dope slap. Instead, today, when I call a regulator with a new idea, they listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you ever talk publicly about "valuing" the watershed? Does it make sense to talk about ecosystem services with any of your audiences?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> The answer to that really depends on the audience. That term is pretty esoteric, and we have visitors from all over the world looking at our technologies. So we talk about the results, but we don’t necessarily use that term.</span></p>

Doug Kenney (a research collaborator on the study) at the University of Colorado and Fran Spivy-Weber with the California Water Resources Board each shared their takes on the importance of the study, and its relevance to the water sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Bottom Line:<br></span>An Interview with Doug Kenney</strong></p>
<p>[img_assist|nid=77|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=76|height=100]<em>Doug Kenney is Director of Western Water Policy Program at University of Colorado\\\'s Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br>You pick and choose research opportunities every day, what inspired you to work on this study? </strong></p>
<p>The study was motivated by the observation that many of the nation’s power plants are very vulnerable to water shortages and, in some cases, to problems stemming from rising water temperatures. In recent years, many plants that require cooling water have had to temporarily shut down due to a lack of water. Likewise, in regions heavily dependent upon hydroelectric power generation—including much of the western US—reduced streamflows translate directly to reduced energy production, or to a reduced reliability of generation. Part of this is just a function of recent drought conditions, but part of this problem is also reflective of growing competition for water everywhere, and to the fact that the temperature of many waterways has been creeping upward in lockstep with rising air temperatures. The bottom line is that we’ve designed an electricity system in this country that places the water and energy sectors on a collision course, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>The electricity system in the United States is undergoing a rapid transformation, as the role of coal is being sharply reduced, natural gas is booming, new renewable energy technologies are coming online, and so on. Each of these fuels and technologies has different water needs. As government and industry leaders make decisions about which energy generating options to pursue, water needs to be a central part of the discussion. Historically, we haven’t done that, and we are paying the price for that now.</p>
<p><strong>Why should the water community care about which fuels and technologies are used to generate electricity in the future?</strong></p>
<p>There’s two reasons. First, if a current or proposed powerplant is threatened by a water shortage, then the utility will likely do whatever it takes to secure additional water supplies. That puts the electric utility in competition with all other water-using sectors, and in government and market settings, electricity generation is a tough competitor. Water currently used for agriculture and the environment is most vulnerable. And second, if the utility is incapable of securing sufficient water supplies and electricity generation is reduced, then that impacts all energy-intensive sectors. Well, moving and treating water is extremely energy-intensive, especially in places like southern California and central Arizona. In those places, competition between water and energy creates a huge problem, as you need ample and reliable supplies of both water and energy to sustain economies, communities, and environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You’ve characterized the report as “optimistic” and as one that illuminates a “great opportunity”? Why is that?</strong></p>
<p>While it’s true that some electricity generation choices, including many choices made decades ago, pose a threat to water users, the really stunning finding from the study is that by choosing water-smart fuels and technologies going forward, the energy sector can dramatically scale back its water needs and can ease water stress. You need to remember, more water in the US is diverted into power plants than onto fields. Many of those power plants are old, coal-fired units, and they are being retired or retooled at a record pace. Likewise, nuclear power plants are becoming increasingly rare. Well, those are among the most water-hungry technologies for electricity generation. Modern, natural gas power plants use significant amounts of water, but less than the facilities they typically replace, while windmills and PV systems use virtually no water. Thus, the pathway we are already on—termed business as usual in the report—results in at least an 80% reduction in water withdrawals and 40% in water consumption by 2050. That’s encouraging. But if we pursue an electricity future with a strong emphasis on renewable energy and energy efficiency, then reductions in water withdrawals and consumption drop by 97% and 85%, respectively. Additionally, the renewables and efficiency pathway is the nation’s best option for significantly reducing its carbon footprint, and results in customer electricity bills that are 30% lower than business as usual. You’d be hard pressed to find any study of water, climate or energy that uncovers such an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>So how can the lessons of this report be translated into improved public policy?</strong></p>
<p>The key is to ensure that water considerations are part of every discussion about energy choices and climate policy, whether that occurs at a national or state level, or in a local proceeding regarding a particular project. Thus, legislatures and PUCs are obvious forums. Policies that incentivize renewable energy and efficiency improvements, and that discourage carbon emissions, will in most cases be water-friendly. That’s a fortunate coincidence, and means that water considerations can be used to strengthen arguments for choices that already make good sense on other criteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br>What most struck you about this very dense, very comprehensive study? </strong></p>
<p>What most struck me was the integration that’s acknowledged between energy and water and climate. This is the first national look at this integration that I’ve seen. The take-home for the energy audience is that there is very low-hanging fruit for those who are interested in reducing GHG emissions. On the energy side, they’ve worked to do lighting, home retrofits, efficiency, electric cars. And all that needs to happen. But if you want to take it up a notch at the home and business level, water is the best entry to getting GHG savings faster, better and easier. The nice thing is there is often a cost-sharing component between energy and water utilities, so that everyone can stretch their dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this work “connecting the dots” so important to the water community? </strong></p>
<p>For the water community, there are big opportunities in shared projects, and particularly in the financing side of shared projects. In California it’s particularly interesting because of the possibility of shared projects using cap and trade funding, or energy efficiency funding. Those are new funding sources for water agencies. The trick will be to understand what metrics the energy companies use to verify GHG savings. It’s not enough just to say, I saved it. So water agencies will need to be able to show exactly how saving water saved energy, and thus reduced emissions. In different states those criteria will be different.</p>
<p>This report also does obliquely bring up the issue of prioritizing and stretching water supplies, and that always brings up the issue of rate structures. If an agency becomes 100% conserving, and puts into practice the many recommendations in this report, it may need to have its rates restructured. For energy companies, this need is largely taken care of in California. But in the water world, we have a much more decentralized agency structure, and they vary tremendously in their approach to rates and rate structures. So it’s not an easy fix on that front. But in any case, the report’s suggestion for a “water-smart energy policy” is a good one.</p>
<p><strong>What are the study’s most interesting recommendations? </strong></p>
<p>To me, the most interesting recommendations are that nationwide, there is a much stronger need than people have recognized for the energy side of each state and the federal government to include water, and vice versa. That is really the point. If you’re going to achieve your climate and energy reduction goals, it just makes sense to include water. They’ve already included transportation in addressing those climate and energy goals, and water really is next. Pursuing an energy policy that considers water use, both in terms of GHG reductions and the potential risks to water supply (either from drought or competition with other big users), is just good risk analysis.</p>
<p>And there is another noteworthy point here: this is the first report that has addressed the water impacts of energy, and the energy impacts of water. It addresses both sides, and that makes it very comprehensive. I’m thrilled whenever I see water being treated as seriously as it is in this report. The most useful part of this analysis is that it dealt so well and so thoroughly with water use in energy production. And quite frankly we haven’t looked at it very carefully in California, but we will now.</p>
<p><strong>What are the policy implications of this more serious “treatment” of water issues in the energy context?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of policy, the challenge on the policy side is that the management of water and energy resources are frequently in completely different silos whether we’re talking about the federal, state or local levels. So the challenge in following up on this report is how do you each take the other seriously, and incorporate and take account of the other sector’s practices? It’s not impossible. But it does call for people at the highest levels of government in both the energy and water worlds to take it on. It cannot be done at the worker bee level.&nbsp;</p>
