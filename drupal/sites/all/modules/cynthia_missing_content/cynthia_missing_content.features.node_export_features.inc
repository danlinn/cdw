<p>Here at home, the California Climate Change Center tells us that the state can expect hotter springs and summers, and longer and more frequent heat waves. California will see less rain and snow by at least 10 percent, and more wildfires.</p>
<p>As in the rest of the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/American+West/" target="_blank">American West,</a>&nbsp;climate change is already making itself felt through our&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/water+supplies/" target="_blank">water supplies.</a>&nbsp;How much rain or snow California receives, and when, as well as evaporation and runoff rates, are already changing. In the face of these changes, water security must be an increasingly critical focus – both for our communities and for statewide policymakers.</p>
<p>While much recent media attention has been devoted to the future of water exported by the large state and federal water projects out of the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/Sacramento-San+Joaquin+Delta/" target="_blank">Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,</a>&nbsp;it\\\'s time to explore what climate change means for the 85 percent of California\\\'s&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/water+supply/" target="_blank">water supply</a>&nbsp;that does not depend on those Delta exports.</p>
<p>California\\\'s farms, commerce, industry and 38 million residents rely in large part on water that flows from headwaters forests – many of them on public land from the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/Feather+River/" target="_blank">Feather River</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/Owens+Valley/" target="_blank">Owens Valley</a>&nbsp;to Hetch Hetchy.</p>
<p>Whether remote or right in our backyards, the headwaters of California\\\'s rivers and streams are essential to our water security. These forests capture and hold snow in the winter. Their soils soak up water from snowmelt like enormous sponges, providing a natural cleansing filter, replenishing aquifers, and moderating floods and high flows as the water moves downhill toward its many users. Headwaters forests are the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/savings+accounts/" target="_blank">savings accounts</a>&nbsp;for water security in California and the West.</p>
<p>Today, these watershed regions are at risk. Emerging threats include severe drought, higher levels of insect infestations, invasive species and excessive erosion. Wildfires like those now blazing around the state bring massive post-fire washouts of sediment – clogging rivers and streams. Many headwaters are also weakened by past forest management legacies.</p>
<p>These challenges imperil our headwaters\\\' ability to continue to provide clean, dependable supplies of water to the millions of people, farms and businesses that rely on them.</p>
<p>With growing awareness of these problems, new allies for healthy headwaters forests are emerging. There are plenty of success stories from around the West that California would do well to emulate.</p>
<p>In Denver, for example, water managers partner with the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/U.S.+Forest+Service/" target="_blank">U.S. Forest Service</a>&nbsp;to protect and restore the forests that provide the city with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/drinking+water/" target="_blank">drinking water.</a>&nbsp;Their Forest to Faucet Partnership will protect nearly 40,000 acres of headwaters forests at a cost of about $33 million. The tab for water customers? A tiny 14 cents per month.</p>
<p>As Ron Lehr, former president of the Denver Water Board, says: "We realized water doesn\\\'t come out of the stream – it comes out of the forest."</p>
<p>Headwaters protection efforts linking cities to their water sources are also under way in Oregon,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.sacbee.com/New+Mexico/" target="_blank">New Mexico,</a>&nbsp;Arizona, Utah and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In California, we have an opportunity to make the same connections. Water and climate can become the drivers for a new era of public lands management, securing funding and incentives to protect the best headwaters forests and restore the rest. Doing so will go a long way toward ensuring the long-term water security of our communities in the face of a changing climate.</p>
<p>Former California Natural Resources Secretary Lester Snow and Gap Inc. Director Bob Fisher recently called for a different way of thinking about water issues, urging investments in multi-benefit local supply projects, water reuse and other efficiency measures.</p>
<p>This direction makes sense for California, particularly in combination with a renewed focus on protection of water supplies at their source. Investing in the natural infrastructure provided by headwaters ecosystems connects upstream and downstream communities in a shared mission for water supply and ecological resilience.</p>
<p>The climate news is sobering. But we have the opportunity now to advance innovative policies that will help modernize our approach to water. Only then will we be able to ensure that we have enough water to meet all of the needs of a 21st century economy and environment.</p>

<p>While it may seem obvious that everyone should have a right to clean, affordable and accessible water, the unfortunate reality is that for many Californians, and indeed for many people nation- and world-wide, access to safe and clean water for critical home use <a href="http://blogs.alternet.org/danbacher/2011/08/31/u-n-water-report-focuses-on-california-problems/">remains out of reach</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AB 685 directs state agencies to employ all “reasonable” means to implement the new policy, and promises a real change in how the state has addressed water quality issues for many communities.</p>
<p>We at Carpe Diem West are focused on headwaters forest restoration and protection as an essential element in the clean water cycle for human communities. Across the American West, water managers are recognizing that water supply and water quality depend in large part on the health and well-being of the headwaters from which so much of our water supply flows. Healthy headwaters mean clean water supplies for downstream users, and AB 685’s marks an important shift in state policy that should include attention to headwaters.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for our State’s unhealthy water supplies, ranging from polluted groundwater to inferior treatment protocols. Focusing on healthy headwaters for the many districts whose supplies originate in upstream forests is a multi-benefit strategy that will help ensure safer supplies up and down the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Governor may not yet be looking to our growing network for major policy solutions, it has much to offer. &nbsp;Our <a href="http://www.carpediemwest.org/sites/carpediemwest.org/files/Healthy%20Headwaters%20Policy%20Platform%204-23-12.pdf">Healthy Headwaters Policy Platform</a> (pdf) is a broadly supported agenda that speaks directly to these issues. It includes a 5-part call for action that could do much to begin implementing the human right to water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal funding for key forest restoration efforts affecting water sources.</li>
<li>State protection for drinking water sources.</li>
<li>Programs at the local government and water utility levels to share the cost of watershed investment.</li>
<li>Public education to help ratepayers become more aware of the role healthy headwaters play in providing their drinking water and the value of investing in those watersheds.</li>
<li>Engaging business leaders in appreciating the degree to which their ventures rely upon the connection between healthy headwaters and downstream water supply quality and quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of work ahead to ensure that everyone has access to safe drinking water, but preservation and protection of our often neglected headwaters regions is an important part of the answer. Some water agencies are understandably concerned about the potential costs of HR 685; we’re looking forward to working with water districts on the front lines in California to find innovative solutions that will provide clean, safe and affordable supplies to everyone.</p>\',

    \'body\' => \'<p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-the-age-of-western-wildfires-14873">new study</a>&nbsp;by Climate Central has documented the obvious: fires in the American West are getting hotter, more intense and more frequent. As researcher Alyson Kenward noted in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-1004-kenward-fire-climate-change-20121004,0,3266044.story">LA Times</a>&nbsp;last week, over the last decade western states have experienced more than 100 major fires on Forest Service land, up from fewer than 50 on average just 40 years ago. According to Climate Central, there are now 5 times more fires larger than 25,000 acres than in the 1970s on average.<!--break--></p>
<p>Whatever your politics, this is deeply concerning, particularly for water managers and policy makers. While Westerners are experiencing the effects of climate change in many ways, we know that changes in water supply and quality have already begun to hit the region hard. And fire is a major driver of these changes. Water managers have long known what others are now beginning to recognize – water doesn’t come from streams, but&nbsp;<a href="http://carpediemwest.org/blog/healthy-headwaters-are-key-water-future-sacramento-bee-op-ed">from forests</a>.</p>
<p>Fires hurt the ability of forests and headwaters areas to provide water for downstream use by depositing massive sediment and debris loads into our rivers. The hotter and more frequent the fires, the heavier the loading. Intense fire can also sterilize forest landscapes, so less water is captured and retained. Unfortunately, these impacts can last for many years.</p>
<p>Many Western water managers are developing innovative programs linking headwaters protection to downstream water supply security, specifically focused on limiting and mitigating fire risk. Santa Fe, for example, is working on a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carpediemwest.org/sites/carpediemwest.org/files/Santa%20Fe%20Success%20Story_0.pdf">20-year comprehensive watershed</a>&nbsp;(pdf) management plan, outlining goals for water and vegetation management, public education, and funding.</p>
<p>In Denver, following 2002’s largest forest fire in Colorado history, heavy rains sent more than a million cubic yards of ash and soil downhill and into one of Denver Water’s reservoir, which supplies water for over a million people. The price tag was over $40 million to clean up the mess, with costs for water quality treatment, sediment and debris removal, land reclamation, and new infrastructure. The experience led to a new way of looking at the value of protecting headwaters landscapes and today Denver is at the forefront of watershed management with its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carpediemwest.org/sites/carpediemwest.org/files/Denver%20Success%20Story_112211.pdf">Forest to Faucet partnership</a>&nbsp;(pdf) with the US Forest Service.</p>
<p>In the study released last week, Climate Central’s Alyson Kenward noted that “for every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in temperature rise, the size of the area burned in the Western U.S. could quadruple.” The challenge to preserve our headwaters landscapes has never been greater, and the need to do so to secure our future water supplies never more urgent.</p>

    \'teaser\' => \'<p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/report-the-age-of-western-wildfires-14873">new study</a>&nbsp;by Climate Central has documented the obvious: fires in the American West are getting hotter, more intense and more frequent. As researcher Alyson Kenward noted in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-1004-kenward-fire-climate-change-20121004,0,3266044.story">LA Times</a>&nbsp;last week, over the last decade western states have experienced more than 100 major fires on Forest Service land, up from fewer than 50 on average just 40 years ago. According to Climate Central, there are now 5 times more fires larger than 25,000 acres than in the 1970s on average.\',

<p>Even if Carpe Diem West were not a recipient, these awards are a terrific idea, promoting and celebrating wonky and mind-bogglingly technical efforts, usually involving thousands of thankless hours around tables in windowless conference rooms. These collaborations do not produce the type of splashy headlines that flow from lawsuits and conflict. Moreover, their results are rarely dramatic or transformative, tending more toward the type of incremental but essential progress necessary for durable solutions. So kudos to the Administration for acknowledging the power of shared effort and collaboration around innovative conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>

    \'body\' => \'<p>Big Congratulations to Carpe Diem West’s now-former Board Member, Ann Chan who was sworn&nbsp;in this week as Deputy Secretary for Climate Change and Energy at the California&nbsp;Natural Resources Agency.  Ann is not only a brilliant attorney and policy wonk with degrees in economics&nbsp;and law from Stanford and Yale respectively, but she is a visionary thinker and great friend.<!--break--></p>
<p>We are fortunate to have had Ann as a leader on our Board of Directors for the last few years as Carpe Diem West has gotten off the ground and built its programs, particularly the <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/HealthyHeadwaters">Healthy Headwaters Alliance</a>.  More than many people, Ann has the breadth of experience to connect climate change issues with forest and water policy, in addition to emissions and energy policies.  She served until recently as the Senior Climate Change Specialist for The Wilderness Society, and the San Francisco office of the Center for Clean Air Policy (CCAP), a DC-based think tank specializing in climate change policy.  She has worked as well as counsel for EPA and in private practice.</p>
<div>
<p>In her new capacity, Ann will be in a unique position to help California shape its natural resource policy agenda in a way that acknowledges and addresses the <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/releases/2012_releases/2012-07-31_climate_change_impacts_and_challenges.pdf">challenges of climate change</a> (PDF). Governor Brown, Secretary Laird, and CalEPA Secretary Nichols  have made clear their commitment to ensuring that California, as the eighth largest economy on the planet, will play a leading role in meeting these challenges.  We cannot think of anyone better than Ann Chan to join their team.</p>
<p>On behalf of Carpe Diem West’s Board and staff, we hope you will join us in wishing Ann every success in her new role with California’s Department of Natural Resources.</p>

<p>Carpe Diem West’s <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/HHPortland">6th Healthy Headwaters Leadership Convening</a> in Portland last week was a resounding success, with inspiring tales of utilities and others increasingly investing in green infrastructure as tools, funding and politics come together.<!--break--> The meeting featured a blend of local heroes (for example, the Portland Water Bureau, Ecotrust, Willamette Partnership, Earth Economics, Eugene Water &amp; Electric, Freshwater Trust) and new partners from around the West (e.g., the Northern California Water Association, City of Santa Fe, the Clark Fork Coalition).</p>
<p>The convening began with positive research news from our friends at Resource Media about a growing nationwide meme that restoring nature has direct, economically productive benefits for human communities.  We did a deep dive on the McKenzie River Collaborative and learned that in bringing together a strong economic case with solid local outreach a large utility was able to overcome traditional biases toward hardscape solutions to <a href="http://www.eweb.org/sourceprotection/vip">invest in its watershed</a> as an economically viable alternative to achieve better water supply reliability.</p>
<p>We heard about a potential new effort to use a national forest in the PNW to demonstrate biological performance metrics, and using <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/wwri/">stream restoration</a> to meet water quality standards, and the Forest Service’s efforts to provide a comprehensive approach to assessing watersheds and prioritizing restoration efforts.  Small groups explored potential approaches for federal policy scaffolding to provide better support for healthy headwaters efforts at the local level, elevating the profile of <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/what-we-do/healthy-headwaters-background">flagship communities</a> and developing a watershed investment network.</p>
<p>We ended the day a bit differently than in the past, hearing from a panel of seasoned political staff representing U.S. Senate and House members as well as states, to help the participants recall that all of their work occurs in an over-arching <a href="http://www.resource-media.org/conservation-in-congress/">political landscape</a> with its own needs and priorities.</p>
<p>Like our past convenings, the Portland meeting was rich in success stories, technical information and exciting contacts.  But it is also a meeting that builds on the assets of prior convenings and is likely to lead Carpe Diem and its <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/HealthyHeadwaters">Healthy Headwaters Alliance</a> in an evolving direction toward the generation of specific initiatives and policy goals.

<p><a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/09/australia-too-hot-to-pump-gas-needs-new-colors/" target="_blank"></a>It is crazy hot in Australia these days.  Indeed, the headline for this story in <em>Time Magazine</em> is “Its Now So Hot in Australia that Gasoline Evaporates Before You Can Pump It.”  And they are not kidding, it is <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/too-hot-to-refuel-as-town-bakes/story-fncynjr2-1226549873359" target="_blank">literally too hot to pump gas</a> in parts of the country.</p>
<p>But perhaps more interesting than the depressing need for new colors on the weather map, is that this story ran not in <em><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/" target="_blank">Mother Jones</a></em> or online at <em><a href="http://grist.org/" target="_blank">Grist</a></em>, but in <em>Time</em>.  When a publication that more or less defines conventional wisdom and the American mainstream <a href="http://science.time.com/2013/01/08/2012-was-the-hottest-year-in-u-s-history-and-yes-its-climate-change/" target="_blank">directly acknowledges the realities of climate change</a>, is it too much to hope that a tipping point in the public’s views on the threats to our climate might not be far behind?</p>
<p>For years, progress on climate policy – and related water policy -- has been stymied by the sense that there is no political mandate to address the issue.  Amid conflicting statements and representations about science, and indeed whether the entire discussion about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change is a “hoax,” a confused and annoyed (if somewhat anxious) public has gone about its daily business and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>That appears to be changing, with <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/06/13/498892/public-understanding-of-climate-science-rebounds-72-of-independents-say-there-is-solid-evidence-of-global-warming/?mobile=nc" target="_blank">several polls</a> finding growing acceptance about the problem on the part of the American public.    Climate acknowledgement is a first critical step toward climate action.</p>

<p>The World Bank says that at current trends, the Earth could warm by 4 degrees Celsius in 50 years. The last time we think this happened was roughly 14 million years ago.&nbsp; In light of the obvious and near term implications for the health, wealth and well-being of people – extreme heat, drought, insect infestations killing off huge swaths of forests nationwide, decreased water supplies, etc. – one would think that there would be a strong incentive on the part of political leaders to make climate responses a key national priority and take serious action.&nbsp; And certainly many people took notice of the President’s decision to focus on climate issues in his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/climate-change-prominent-in-obamas-inaugural-address.html?_r=0" target="_blank">inaugural address</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when asked about climate policy and a legislative proposal to tax carbon, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/23/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-1232013" target="_blank">President’s spokesman indicated</a> that climate change is a “real issue”&nbsp;and that dealing with it is an “important goal,” but at the same time the Administration has “no intention of proposing a carbon tax.”</p>
<p>Certainly there are a lot of different ways to tackle the enormous challenges presented by the mounting evidence of the catastrophic problems that our country and our children, not to mention the rest of the globe, will be facing due to climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither a carbon tax nor any other single measure is a silver bullet, of course. &nbsp;There are no silver bullets. &nbsp;But it is deeply troubling that the scientific and political worlds are continuing to talk past each other, as if neither is capable of recognizing the scale of the other.&nbsp; It will take a more fully engaged public to move the political meter, and the question is what devastating inflection point it will take for that to happen.</p>\',

<p>In two weeks, Carpe Diem West will release a new report showcasinging 10 western communities experimenting with sustainable approaches to water management that could have broad applications across the West and the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>The report, <em>New Visions, Smart Choices – Western Water Security in a Changing Climate,</em> will highlight no-regrets strategies that can build resilience and durability into Western water systems now and in the future.&nbsp; Stories will include Salt Lake City’s aggressive efforts to buy and conserve land where its source waters originate to limit development, and other land practices harmful to water supply and quality, while educating the public about its stake in the watershed.&nbsp; The Upper Yampa Water District was able to employ unique funding arrangements to lease water from willing sellers to keep water in the Yampa River for recreation, tourism and fishing during a serious drought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board has gone into the business of persuading local farmers to become certified organic food providers – all in the service of limiting the application of harmful pesticides on watershed land that would otherwise require expensive water quality treatments.&nbsp; As one local grower has said:&nbsp; “We all want clean water, and EWEB helps me pay the difference so I can use soft pesticides and lime in my orchard instead of nitrates. I’m happy to work with them - and I think everyone around here feels the same way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value in getting these stories out and into wider circulation is that we must do more than despair in the face of climate change and our national political leaders’ unprincipled failure to take meaningful action.&nbsp; It is important for the public and other water managers to know that there are real world, on the ground models for ensuring that our communities have the water that they require going forward in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>Carpe Diem West will be rolling out <em>New Visions, Smart Choices</em> at the <a href="http://www.commonwealthclub.org/node/64487?utm_source=Commonwealth+Club+invite&amp;utm_campaign=Commonwealth+Invite+3-13-13&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">Commonwealth Club</a> on March 26 at 6:00 p.m. Check it out!</p>\',

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Did you know that tomorrow, March 22, is <a href="http://www.unwater.org/water-cooperation-2013/home/en/" target="_blank">World Water Day</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The good news is that the UN has declared a day focused on water issues.&nbsp; The bad news is that few Americans know or care about it.&nbsp; And why should they?&nbsp; For the vast majority of us, water is not only clean, safe, plentiful and reliable -- it is dirt cheap.&nbsp; <!--break-->Even here in the drier West, unless you’re irrigating vast landscapes or growing a lot of tomatoes, water is often a homeowner’s cheapest bill, far less than, say, basic cable.&nbsp; So many, if not most Americans, have little sense that water is something they need to be aware of in their daily lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But our changing climate means that change is coming to our water supplies, as weather gets hotter, wildfire threats become more severe, and precipitation changes and diminishes.&nbsp; So World Water Day is a great opportunity to pause and take stock of the importance of water for all of us and our collective responsibility to advocate for sustainable management of freshwater supplies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is a particularly auspicious World Water Day because it is the launch of the U.N.’s “<a href="http://www.unwater.org/watercooperation2013.html" target="_blank">International Year of Water Cooperation</a>.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And at Carpe Diem West we could not agree more; cooperation really is the key to teaching and making change happen.&nbsp; The U.S. is planning to “highlight the history of successful water cooperation initiatives, as well as identify burning issues on water education, water diplomacy, transboundary water management, financing cooperation,” and other issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ensuring the sustainability of clean water is a critically important goal and will become more so with every passing year.&nbsp; Stay tuned for a new Carpe Diem West report being released next week that will help everyone think about how best to make water supplies in their communities more secure in a changing climate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Come back Monday!</span></p>

<p>A hallmark of our work at Carpe Diem West has been to build networks around the West addressing the challenge of water sustainability. We are delighted to be highlighting ten major successes in our partner communities.&nbsp; These remarkable stories represent “no regrets” strategies that have important applications across the West and beyond.&nbsp; <!--break-->Stories like these demonstrate that there is a great deal that we can do right now, even in this time of climate change, to protect our rivers and build a secure water future with innovation, creativity, and a willingness to think a bit differently about water going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>New Visions, Smart Choices </em>spotlights sustainable and economically sensible steps that these western communities are taking to ensure they will have water in the decades to come.&nbsp; Salt Lake City is paying for backcountry forest rangers to protect watershed lands outside of the City’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; San Antonio is recycling 17 million gallons of water per day for industrial use (and golf courses!).&nbsp; A non-profit in Colorado is leasing water from a willing water conservation district to keep the Yampa River flowing in a drought.&nbsp; Eugene, OR is persuading local farmers to go organic to limit toxic pesticides from entering drinking supplies – it’s cheaper to keep it out than to clean it up.&nbsp; And there’s more.</p>
<p>Every day the news brings us disturbing facts and figures about our climate present and future.&nbsp; For just about everyone, (unless you happen to be serving as a minority member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee) it is clear that big changes are underway; but there is hope and there is a community spirit taking hold in the West to seize the opportunities to ensure that we all continue to enjoy sustainable water into the future – whatever that looks like.</p>

<p>What makes both articles interesting is their depiction of changing attitudes.&nbsp; While lawns are still considered “a God-given right” by some Texans, others are going public with their views that “things like that don’t make sense.”&nbsp; Indeed, the entire thrust of the article is that what has been a political third rail may be becoming part of the water conversation – last week the <a href="http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/198837771.html" target="_blank">Texas Legislature took a key step</a> by passing a bill guaranteeing the right of landowners to install drought-resistant landscaping.</p>
<p>Similarly in New Mexico, what would have been unthinkable not long ago is not only being thunk, but spoken aloud as some people are saying that the “all-or-nothing dynamic of prior appropriation instantly sets up conflict; I get all of mine, and you get nothing,” and labeling the longstanding western water rights system “unfair and anachronistic.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what’s going on?&nbsp; The new reality of water shortages means that even deeply entrenched views are starting to give way to a new pragmatism and openness of spirit.&nbsp; Change can be hard, but also enlivening and liberating.&nbsp; Given the comment pages on these stories (and to be fair, it is the New York Times), it looks like there may be the beginning of a new wind blowing across the West.&nbsp; If you have not yet seen it, check out <a href="http://carpediemwest.org/newvisions-smartchoices" target="_blank">Carpe Diem West’s new report</a> on how 10 Western communities are getting ahead of the curve already!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    \'title\' => \'Climate and Water Observations from California\',
    \'body\' => \'<p>[img_assist|nid=256|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=640|height=480]Jay Lund is a smart guy who has written compellingly about California water for many years.&nbsp;<!--break--> In a <a href="http://californiawaterblog.com/2013/01/13/climate-change-and-california-water-past-present-and-future/" target="_blank">recent blog</a> (somehow January still seems recent), Dr. Lund provides a number of thoughtful observations about water and climate change, but my favorite is # 7: “Handwringing is not adaptation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His overarching point is that water management, particularly in the West, has always involved significant uncertainties.&nbsp; A key take-away is that managing water in the time of climate change will involve a diverse portfolio.&nbsp; There is no single silver bullet, but increasingly a need for an array of integrated strategies including but not limited to water use efficiency, markets, and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as well as alternative management of the considerable water infrastructure in place.&nbsp; This emphasis on flexibility, nimbleness and openness to new ideas is precisely the message of Carpe Diem West’s <a href="http://www.carpediemwest.org/newvisions-smartchoices" target="_blank">recent report on 10 Western success stories</a>.</p>
<p>From San Diego to San Antonio, western water managers are embracing commonsense approaches that center on using water more wisely and more economically.</p>
<p>To Dr. Lund’s list of management options, we would add a greater focus on restoration and preservation of headwaters landscapes that are the source of so much of the West’s water supply.&nbsp; As highlighted in <em>New Visions, Smart Choices</em>, keeping headwaters healthy is not only effective and fiscally smart water management, but also creates more opportunities for multiple benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a point that <a href="http://www.slcgov.com/utilities/public-utilities-watershed" target="_blank">Salt Lake City</a> water manager Laura Briefer emphasizes: protecting our headwaters forests provides so many benefits in addition to maintaining water supply and water quality – flood mitigation, air quality, biodiversity, recreation – as well as increased ecosystem resilience in a time of climate change.</p>
<p>So while handwringing in the face of climate change is understandable, we tend to agree with Jay Lund’s pragmatic approach.&nbsp; Oh, and another of Dr. Lund’s excellent points?&nbsp; “<em>Everyone talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.”&nbsp;</em> (Attributed<em> to </em>Charles Dudley Warner, 1897)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">But in the near term, water managers of all stripes are calling attention to the challenges posed by climate change not in some distant future, but in the coming season which promises to continue the trend toward hotter and drier weather.&nbsp; One of the federal government’s top water officials, Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Mike Connor, noted that 2013 could be the fourth-driest year in the basin in the past 100 years, and indeed that a <a href="http://durangoherald.com/article/20130527/NEWS02/130529520/Colorado-River’s-future-focus-of-conference" target="_blank">shortage in the Basin is possible by 2016</a>.<!--break--></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">With that reality setting in, ripples of innovation (in addition to alarm!) are spreading around the Basin, and today’s news gives us three reasons for optimism:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1. Largely dependent on the Colorado and other remote sources of imported water, the <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/may/29/tp-water-managers-focus-on-the-colorado-river/" target="_blank">San Diego Water Authority</a> has been placing ever increasing emphasis on water use efficiency and diversification of its water supplies to obtain higher levels of local resilience and reliability, while emphasizing the theme of working with a broad array of interests in the Basin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">2. Denver water CEO Jim Lochhead and Colorado Trout Unlimited ED David Nickum have a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_23364868/together-we-can-meet-colorado-river-challenges" target="_blank">piece in the Denver Post</a> today similarly stressing that forward progress will turn in no small part on finding greater areas of shared interest and cooperation. &nbsp;Lochhead and Nickum don’t deny their differences, but its good news when such key institutions state a “shared interest in a healthy Colorado River” and take a leadership role in declaring that the path forward is through smarter water planning and cooperation. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">3. The Environmental Defense Fund, also a long-time partner and leader on Colorado River solutions, has put forward a <a href="http://www.edf.org/news/edf-calls-swift-action-common-sense-solutions-colorado-river" target="_blank">commonsense set of substantive recommendations</a> for forward progress that respond directly to the concerns of water managers and conservation groups that could generate significant benefits in the near-term.&nbsp; Grounded in the recommendations of the Basin Study itself, EDF proposes among other action: (1) more efficient use of existing urban water supplies, (2) wastewater reuse, (3) improved watershed management, and (4) water banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The challenges to ideas like these are always great, of course.&nbsp; But the consequences of failing to act are considerably greater, and becoming more so every day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you live at sea level or a mile up in the sky, these are disparate efforts but all on the same theme, and the time is ripe for more basin-wide solutions.</span></p>
